        <h1>History Of ACLC Taytay</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Established in 1997, ACLC College of Taytay, initially located at Manila East Arcade Bldg. Brgy. San Juan, Taytay, Rizal, has evolved into a premier institution now situated at #7 El Monteverde Subdivision, Brgy. San Juan, Taytay, Rizal. Committed to providing quality education, ACLC College of Taytay aims to enhance students' academic capabilities while nurturing faith in God.

            With the implementation of the K-12 system in 2012, ACLC College of Taytay embarked on the journey to cater to senior high school students. Since the academic year 2016-2017, the school has offered three strands: Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM); Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM); and Technical-Vocational Information Communication Technology (ICT). Exceeding expectations, the school enrolled 1,299 students in that academic year.
            
            As a pioneer in IT education under the AMA Education System, ACLC College of Taytay launched "Online Blended Learning" in 2015, fostering student development and contributing to an increase in the school's population.
            
            Beyond academics, the school provides a wide range of extracurricular activities such as leadership training, community service, sports, drama, speech, robotics, and film, enriching students' overall learning experience.
            
            ACLC College of Taytay continues to aspire for growth and success, dedicated to serving its stakeholders with excellence. Recognizing God as the ultimate guide, provider, and sustainer of all blessings, the institution attributes its achievements to Him. TO GOD BE THE GLORY!
